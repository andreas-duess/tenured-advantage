              <summary>Is it too late to learn AI at 50+?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Not at all. While younger workers may learn tools faster, experienced professionals have something more valuable: context. You know what questions to ask, what problems matter, and how to apply technology strategically. AI amplifies that judgment—it doesn't replace it.</p>
              </div>

              <summary>Do I need to become a programmer to use AI?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>No. The most valuable AI skills aren't technical—they're strategic. Understanding how to prompt AI effectively, evaluate outputs critically, and integrate AI into your workflow matters far more than coding. Your decades of professional judgment are the real advantage.</p>

              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>You can start seeing value immediately. This isn't about months of training—it's about strategic shifts in how you work. Many professionals begin getting ROI from AI within days, not weeks. The key is knowing where to start and what matters.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Which AI tool should I start with - ChatGPT, Claude, or something else?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Start with what's free and accessible. ChatGPT and Claude both offer free tiers that are more than enough to begin. ChatGPT is excellent for brainstorming and creative work, while Claude excels with long documents and detailed analysis. Don't get paralyzed by choice—pick one, use it for a week on real work, then try the other. You'll quickly learn which fits your needs.</p>
              </div>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Can I learn AI on my own, or do I need formal training?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Most experienced professionals learn best by doing, not by taking courses. Start using AI tools on actual work problems—that practical experience teaches you more than any certification. Formal training can help if you want structure, but it's not required. Your professional judgment will guide you faster than any curriculum.</p>

              <summary>Won't AI replace experienced workers first?</summary>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What if I'm worried about ageism in the workplace?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Ageism is real—78% of workers over 50 have experienced it. But there's also growing demand for experienced professionals who understand AI. By 2030, there will be 150 million more jobs for workers 55+. The key is positioning yourself as someone who combines experience with modern capabilities—not one or the other.</p>
              </div>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Will employers still hire experienced professionals who learn AI?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Yes, but you need to demonstrate capability, not just claim it. Don't lead with years of experience—lead with what you can do now. Show examples of how you use AI in your work. Talk about results, not resume. Employers hiring for AI-related work care more about current skills than past titles.</p>
              </div>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What if I'm already facing ageism - will AI skills really help?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>AI skills won't eliminate ageism, but they change the conversation. When you can demonstrate you're solving problems others can't, age becomes less relevant. Focus on positioning yourself in roles where judgment and experience matter more than speed and availability. Target companies that value outcomes over optics.</p>

              <summary>Which roles are most at risk and which are safest for experienced professionals?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Junior to mid-level roles that follow templates and processes are most at risk. Senior roles requiring strategic thinking, relationship management, and complex judgment are safest. If your value comes from knowing what to do (not just how to do it), you're well-positioned. Focus on advisory, strategic, and leadership roles where experience is the advantage.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What AI tasks should I start with in my current role?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Start with tasks that drain your time but don't require your judgment. Email drafting. Meeting summaries. Research synthesis. Data analysis. Document review. Pick one repetitive task you do weekly, give it to AI, and refine the output. Once you see results, expand from there.</p>

              <summary>How do I know if AI is actually working for me?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Track simple metrics: time saved, quality of output, decisions improved. If you're not saving at least 30 minutes per day within two weeks, you're using the wrong tool or asking the wrong questions. AI should make your work noticeably faster or better. If it doesn't, adjust your approach.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Do I need to use AI every day to stay current?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Not every day, but regularly enough that it becomes natural. Think of it like email—you don't use it for everything, but when it's the right tool, you use it automatically. Aim for 3-4 times per week on real work. That's enough to build capability without overwhelming yourself.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What if I try AI and it doesn't give me good results?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Bad outputs usually mean unclear inputs. AI responds to specificity. Instead of "write a report," try "write a 2-page executive summary on Q4 sales trends for the board, focusing on regional differences and actionable recommendations." The more context you provide, the better the results. Treat it like briefing a smart junior colleague.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How do I stay current when AI changes so fast?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Don't try to learn everything. Focus on tools that solve your specific problems. Follow 2-3 trusted sources (not 20). Test new features when they're relevant to your work, not because they're trending. Your goal isn't to be an AI expert—it's to use AI effectively for what you already do.</p>

              <summary>How much does AI training actually cost?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>It ranges wildly. Self-directed learning using free tools costs nothing. Online certifications run $150-$500. University programs cost $2,300-$3,500. Executive training programs can reach $50,000. Start with free tools and practical application. Only invest in formal training once you know what specific skills you need.</p>

              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Both, depending on how you position it. If you use AI to do your current job better, you protect what you have. If you use AI to take on work you couldn't do before, you create leverage for advancement. Document your results. Quantify your impact. Then use that evidence when negotiating.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Do I need to pay for premium AI tools, or are free versions enough?</summary>
              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Free versions are enough to start. Only upgrade when you hit real limitations—like needing faster responses, more complex analysis, or higher usage limits. Most professionals find value in free tiers for months. Upgrade when the subscription pays for itself in time saved, not before.</p>

              <div class="faq-content">
                <p>The tools are the same, but the application differs. Traditional industries benefit most from using AI for operations, analysis, and efficiency—not building AI products. Tech companies experiment constantly. Traditional industries need proven, reliable implementation. Your advantage is knowing your industry deeply enough to spot where AI actually adds value vs. where it's just hype.</p>
