              <p>
                I'm in my 50s, and I use AI every day to run my life and my companies. This site exists because I keep hearing the same story from professionals just like me - and it needs to change.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>The Story I Keep Hearing</h2>
              <p>
                Over the past year, I've worked with dozens of experienced professionals in their late 40s to early 60s. They're marketing directors, consultants, operations leaders, accountants—people who've spent 20 to 30 years building deep expertise. Most of them love their work. They have emotional intelligence that only comes with time, business judgment that prevents expensive mistakes, and the kind of well-rounded perspective that makes them invaluable to any organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                But here's what they're experiencing:
              </p>
              <p>
                They're facing ageism. Not subtle, not occasional, but pervasive and documented. <strong>78% of workers over 50 have experienced it.</strong> 93% believe it's rife in workplaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                And here's the part that really makes my blood boil: <strong>9 in 10 hiring managers acknowledge that midcareer and older workers perform as well as or better than younger colleagues</strong>, yet they admit they're <strong>more likely to consider candidates under 35 for AI-related roles</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The assumptions are everywhere: You're too old to learn. You can't be trained. AI will leave you behind. You're not as energetic. You're more expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>None of it is true.</strong>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>The Numbers Tell a Different Story</h2>
              <p>
                The research reveals something that experienced professionals already know but the market seems determined to ignore:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>68% of professionals 50+ think it's very important to start building AI skills</strong>—they're not checked out, they're leaning in</li>
                <li>While 30% feel overwhelmed (compared to 22% of younger workers), <strong>about a quarter who aren't currently using AI tools are actively interested in learning</strong></li>
                <li>Workers who engaged in AI upskilling showed <strong>27% higher job retention rates</strong></li>
                <li>There will be <strong>150 million more jobs worldwide going to workers 55+ by 2030</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The market isn't shrinking. The opportunity isn't disappearing. What's happening is that experienced professionals are being systematically underestimated while simultaneously seeking to upskill.

              <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
              <p>
                I'm in my 50s myself. I've spent 30+ years bridging technology and traditional industries—starting at Ogilvy London, then working with global tech clients like Cisco, Adobe, HP, and Google. I pioneered B2B digital marketing before it was mainstream.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2007, I co-founded Nourish Marketing and built it into one of Canada's leading marketing agencies before successfully exiting in 2023. That 16-year journey taught me firsthand how to transform established businesses in traditional industries, which is exactly what I now help other leaders do with AI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I'm CEO of 6 Seeds, CEO of Ditto (a synthetic market research platform), and I teach AI strategy at Ivey Business School. I keynote at conferences worldwide, write a column on AI and market transformation for Food in Canada Magazine, and advise the Canadian government on AI and trade policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                But more importantly: <strong>I use AI daily.</strong> Not to replace my judgment, but to amplify it. Not to do my job for me, but to make me better at the job I've spent decades learning to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                And here's what I've discovered: The professionals I work with who are in their late 40s to early 60s don't have an AI disadvantage. <strong>They have an unfair advantage.</strong>
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2>The Truth About Experience + AI</h2>
              <p>
                While others chase AI trends, experienced professionals have something far more valuable: context, judgment, and the wisdom to know what questions to ask.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI amplifies what you already know. It doesn't replace expertise—it multiplies it. The judgment to know what matters, the pattern recognition to spot what's changed, the relationship intelligence to navigate complexity—these are the skills that AI makes more valuable, not less.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your 20 years of experience just became a superpower. But only if you know how to use it.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2>What This Site Is For</h2>
              <p>
                I built Tenured Advantage to share what I've learned about leveraging AI as an experienced professional. This isn't "AI for seniors." This isn't about using chatbots for companionship or brain-training apps. <strong>This is AI for professionals who have decades of expertise and want to amplify their competitive advantage.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                This site is for you if:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>You're in your late 40s to early 60s and still have enormous amounts to give</li>
                <li>You're experiencing or worried about ageism in your career</li>
                <li>You love your work and refuse to be pushed out</li>
                <li>You recognize AI is real but you're skeptical of the hype</li>
                <li>You want practical strategies that work, not theory that sounds impressive</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I'm not here to tell you that age doesn't matter. I'm here to show you that <strong>experience is your unfair advantage</strong> - if you know how to amplify it with AI.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>My Approach</h2>
              <p>
                Practical, not theoretical. Anti-hype, not anti-technology. Focused on outcomes that matter, not AI theatre that looks impressive but delivers nothing.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                "If it doesn't change what you build, buy, or believe, it's just expensive theatre."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                I believe experience isn't a liability—it's an unfair advantage. While others chase AI trends, experienced professionals have context, judgment, and wisdom. We just need to learn how to multiply it with the right tools.
              </p>

              <h2>Get Started</h2>
              <p>
                The purpose of this site is simple: share what I've learned about using AI as an experienced professional. Every insight here comes from actually doing the work—running companies, teaching executives, advising governments, and using AI every single day.
              </p>
              <p>
                You're not too old. You're not behind. You're not being left behind.
              </p>
              <p>
                You're just getting started.
